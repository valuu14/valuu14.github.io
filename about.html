            <p class="styleP1">Tim Bergling was born on 8 September 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden. He has three siblings, David Bergling, Linda Sterner and Anton Körberg. Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16. In May 2007, Avicii signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label. </p> 
            <p class="styleP1">Bergling was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style. By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu" and "Even". Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in several countries, including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden.</p>

            <h4>2011–2013: "Levels" and international breakthrough</h4>
            <p class="styleP1">In 2011, Bergling released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA" class="levels" target="_blank">"Levels"</a>, which launched him into the mainstream. The song was produced by Bergling and contains a vocal sample from the 1962 gospel-inspired "Something's Got a Hold on Me" by Etta James. The same vocal sample was used earlier by Pretty Lights in his 2006 song "Finally Moving". This sample was also used by drum and bass producer Logistics on "Call Me Back" and by Flo Rida in his single "Good Feeling", which was produced by DJ Prak and Cirkut. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA" class="levels" target="_blank">"Levels"</a> reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom, whilst topping the charts in Hungary, Norway and Sweden.</p> 
            <p class="styleP1">In 2012, his collaboration track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO_q3ldG6To" class="levels" target="_blank">"Sunshine"</a> with David Guetta was nominated for a Grammy award under the category for Best Dance Recording. His track "Fade into Darkness" was sampled by Leona Lewis on her single "Collide". The sampling was not accredited and led to controversy as Bergling attempted to block the single's release. The matter was resolved out of court with representatives stating "that Leona Lewis and Avicii will work together on the forthcoming single of Collide".</p> 
            <p class="styleP1">After reaching two million followers on Facebook, Bergling released a new song titled "Two Million". It was put out as a free download on his official Soundcloud page. On 27 April 2012, Bergling released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VJBBUqr1wM" class="levels" target="_blank">"Silhouettes"</a>. The song featured vocals from Salem Al Fakir and peaked at number 5 on the UK Dance charts and number 4 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs.</p>

            <p class="styleP1">On 29 December 2012, Bergling premiered many new songs at Lights All Night, Dallas Convention Center, some of which made it on to his first album, True. These unreleased songs included "I'll Be Gone" and "Let It Go". The instrumental of "Let It Go" was mixed with the a capella of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc9c12q3mrc" class="levels" target="_blank">"Addicted to You"</a> to become "Addicted to You (Avicii by Avicii)".</p> 
            <p class="styleP1">On the same day, Bergling released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bek1y2uiQGA" class="levels" target="_blank">"I Could Be the One"</a> with Nicky Romero. After first being debuted at his shows almost a year earlier, the track finally got released via Bergling's record label LE7ELS. The new vocal version was released along with an instrumental version, a radio edit, and remixes from Audrio and Didrick. On 9 January 2013, Bergling launched the Avicii X You project, a partnership with Ericsson designed to create the world's first "crowdsourced" hit song. The project enabled fans to send in basslines, effects, melodies, rhythms and vocals to Bergling as sound files over the Internet. The song features sequences from Kian Sang (melody), Naxsy (bassline), Martin Kupilas (beat), Ваня Хакси (break), Jonathan Madray, Mateusz Kolata, and Christian Westphalen (effects). Bergling acted as executive producer and created the finished song officially titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpKyzSxVhk4" class="levels" target="_blank">X You</a>, which was released on 26 February 2013. On 30 January 2013, Bergling released "Three Million" featuring Negin to celebrate three million fans on his Facebook page.</p>

            <h4>2013–2014: True</h4>
            <p class="styleP1">In March 2013, Bergling announced and premiered many new tracks from his new album True, which would later be set to be released in September, during his Main Stage set at Ultra Music Festival in Miami. The new tracks were experimental in nature. For example, Bergling brought out a stomping band to play through the new bluegrass-tinged song "Wake Me Up". Many of these new songs received mixed critical reviews after the concert.</p> 
            <p class="styleP1">On 14 June 2013, the world premiere of Bergling's new single, <a href="Wake me up.html" target="_blank" class="levels"> "Wake Me Up"</a>, was previewed by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1, featuring vocals from Aloe Blacc.

It is the first single from Bergling's album True, which was released on 16 September 2013. <a href="Wake me up.html" target="_blank" class="levels"> "Wake Me Up"</a> was number 1 on the Spotify Global Chart and Bergling was at 2 in most streamed artist worldwide. <a href="Wake me up.html" target="_blank" class="levels"> "Wake Me Up"</a> later went on to set a then record of 14 weeks as the number one hit on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Songs list. The Official Charts Company announced on 21 July that <a href="Wake me up.html" target="_blank" class="levels"> "Wake Me Up"</a> had become the UK's fastest selling single of 2013 after overtaking Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines", having sold 267,000 copies in its first week on sale in the UK. <a href="Wake me up.html" target="_blank" class="levels"> "Wake Me Up"</a> subsequently became a major hit, topping the charts in over 20 countries including Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.</p>

            <p class="styleP1">On 10 August 2017, Bergling released the six-track EP Avīci (01). Bergling said of the release: "I'm really excited to be back with music once again. It has been a long time since I released anything and a long time since I was this excited over new music! My focus on this first EP of the album was to get a mix of new and old songs: some that fans have been asking about and waiting for mixed with brand new songs that they haven't heard before!"</p> 
            <p class="styleP1">On 11 September 2017, Bergling announced a documentary entitled Avicii: True Stories</a>. The documentary chronicles the artist's retirement from touring and features interviews from his colleagues David Guetta, Tiësto, Wyclef Jean, Nile Rodgers and Chris Martin of Coldplay.</p>
