	<h1>Tim's Legacy</h1>
</section>

<div class="text">
<p>Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who travelled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress.</p>
<p>When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be able to be happy and to do what he loved most – music.</p>
<p>He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness.</p>
<p>He could now not go on any longer.</p>
<p>He wanted to find peace.</p>
<p>Tim was not made for the business machine he found himself in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned the spotlight.</p>
<p>Tim, you will forever be loved and sadly missed.</p>
<p>The person you were and your music will keep your memory alive.</p>
<br>
<p>We love you,</p>
<p>The Family</p>

	<p>When Tim Bergling passed away on April 20, 2018, he was close to completing a new album. He left behind a collection of nearly finished songs, along with notes, email conversations and text messages about the music.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The songwriters that Tim was collaborating with on this album have continued the process to get as close to his vision as possible.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Since Tim's passing, the family decided not to keep the music locked away – instead they wanted to share it with his fans all around the world.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The single ”SOS” has been released on April 10 and the album, titled ”TIM”, will be released on June 6.</p>

	<p>Produced and written by Tim Bergling, Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir (Vargas & Lagola), the track stays true to the infectious nature of Avicii’s dance smashes and his desire to discover new sounds.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In the Spring of 2017, after Tim had been exploring music from northwest India, he played a melody loop for the two. "Oddly enough, the Indian influences fit perfectly into a song we were working on, something that was so typical of Tim" says Vincent Pontare. "He was a melodic genius.”  </p>
	<br>
	<p>In his notes Tim wrote about "Tough Love": "This one needs to be a duet. Coolest thing would be a real couple. Or a couple that have worked together enough to be almost considered a couple!"</p>
	<br>
	<p>“Tough Love” is the latest track to be released from TIM.</p>
